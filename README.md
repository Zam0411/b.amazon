The purpose of this assignment is to show an understanding on Node.js working with mySQL.

This app has a list of products with a price, amount of stock, department name, product name and is interactively used with Node.js and mySQL by updating the stock amount resulting in a price being totaled from a certain amount of items being purchased in turn updates the mySQL server stock amount. If there are no more of an item an error message appears prompting the user to attempt to purchase another item if interested.

Here is a video demonstration of the app in action:
